 * Description
 * -----------
 * procedure to give a list of options to the user and get the option chosen by the
 * user which is returned
 *
 * the list of available options is defined by a function pointer given with the 
 * addition of quitting the program
 *
 * Inputs
 * ------
 *   numberOptions
 *   - the number of possible options other than exiting the program
 *     numberOptions is the end of the range 1..numberOptions
 *   Menu
 *   - a pointer to the procedure Menu which is called to print the menu of available
 *     options for the user to select from
 *     procedure takes one input - numberOptions - and returns no values
 *     it should solely print a list of options available to the end user which does 
 *     not include 0 to exit the program, that being printed after the other options
 *     by this procedure when Menu has returned  
 * Return Values
 * ------ ------
 *     unsigned int - option chosen by the user which will be between 0 and numberOptions
 *
 * History (with dates)

/**** SetStatus *********************************************************************
 *
 * Version & Date
 * -------   ----
 * 1.0.0, 30/06/1998
 *
 * Description
 * -----------
 * get the user's choice for state of a given option and update the choice based on
 * the previous state (if exists)
 *
 * the state is either "ON" or "OFF" (1 or 0) and the procedure allows the user to 
 * enter incorrect choices in which case the previous state is maintained (if set) 
 * and default choices by hitting <return> which sets the state to "ON" if state
 * not previously set or maintains previous state is set
 *
 * Inputs
 * ------
 *   typeString
 *   - the type for the state that is being set
 *   statusString
 *   - a string that should hold the current state for the type in statusString[ 0 ]
 *     if statusString[ 0 ] == '1' the current state is on
 *     if statusString[ 0 ] == '0' the current state is off
 *     if no state has been set currently, set to anything other than '0' or '1'
 *     all other entries in string statusString are ignored
 *   limit
 *   - the length of statusString that can be used for reading in users choice
 * Outputs
 * -------
 *   statusString
 *   - the status that has been given by the user (or previous state if no change)
 *     statusString[ 0 ] == '1' indicates the state is on
 *     statusString[ 0 ] == '0' indicates the state is off
 *     all other entries in string statusString should be ignored
 * Return Values
 * ------ ------
 *     0  - the state is set to off
 *     1  - the state is set to on
 *     -1 - some error occurred (invalid input arguments)
 *          statusString[ 0 ] may still be valid
