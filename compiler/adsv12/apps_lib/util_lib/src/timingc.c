/**** PrintIterationTimes ***********************************************************
 *
 * Version & Date
 * -------   ----
 * 1.0.0, 30/06/1998
 *
 * Description
 * -----------
 * print the number of iterations remaining, the time taken in hrs, mins & secs for the
 * last section of iterations and the approximate time remaining to perform the
 * number of iterations remaining
 *
 * the procedure is desiged for giving the end user some idea of how long the process
 * is likely to take and is ideal for use in complex loops
 *
 * Inputs
 * ------
 *   itersRemain
 *   - the number of iterations remaining to perform before completion
 *   itersPerLoop
 *   - the number of iterations since the last call to the procedure
 *     this should be a constant number with each call else the timings will not
 *     be correct as they work on averages and this value is not maintained
 *   timePtr
 *   - a pointer to the timing structure which is used between procedure calls to
 *     maintain the necessary information
 *     this structure should be initialised before calling the procedure for the first
 *     time using the procedure InitialiseTimeStructure
 * Outputs
 * -------
 *   timePtr
 *   - the updated timing structure with the information gathered from the current
 *     procedure call added
 *
 * Notes
 * -----
 * the more times the procedure is called the more accurate the approximate time
 * remaining will be since it works on averages, thus initially it may not be a very 
 * good estimate until the timings have settled
