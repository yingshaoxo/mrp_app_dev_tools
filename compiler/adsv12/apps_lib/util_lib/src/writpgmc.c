 * Description
 * -----------
 * write the given PGM data array to the given file
 *
 * Inputs
 * ------
 *   ofp
 *   - a pointer to the open file to write data to
 *   pgm
 *   - the 2-D array of unsigned char image data to write to the file
 *     if NULL is passed the file will be created with all data except PGM image data
 *     (type number, dimensions and maximum value)
 *   width
 *   - the width of the PGM array
 *     the number of columns of PGM pixels in the array (length of each row array)
 *   height
 *   - the height of the PGM array
 *     the number of row of PGM pixels in the array (number of row arrays)
 * Return Values
 * ------ ------
 *     1 - the image was written successfully
 *     0 - some error occurred (file corrupt or incorrect arguments)
 *
 * Notes
 * -----
 * no option is provided to write out type 2 PGM's since type 5 is the preferable type
