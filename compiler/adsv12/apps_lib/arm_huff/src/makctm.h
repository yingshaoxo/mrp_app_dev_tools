 *
 * Version & Date
 * -------   ----
 * 1.0.0, 30/06/1998
 *
 * Description
 * -----------
 * generate the symbol-to-codeword lookup table for each size of symbol data
 *
 * Inputs
 * ------
 *   symbols
 *   - an array of symbols that occur in the data to be coded that must be sorted into
 *     increasing order of frequency of occurrence
 *     the type for the symbols and hence size of symbols must be defined by SIZE before
 *     this macro file is included
 *   nsymbols
 *   - the number of symbols referenced by the symbol array
 *   freqcodelen
 *   - an array of frequency of occurrence for each length of codeword
 *   maxcodewlen
 *   - the maximum length of codeword that can be created
 *     (maxcodewlen + 1) defines the last index into the array freqcodelen
 *     value also defines the position in the codeword that the length of the codeword is packed
 *     and must be the same value that is given to the bit coder function for the code table
 * Return Values
 * ------ ------
 *     unsigned int * - an array that represents the symbol-to-codeword lookup table with the
 *                      codeword in the bottom maxcodewlen bits, the length in the bits over this
 *     NULL			  - some error occurred (memory failed?)
 *
 * Memory allocated (not deallocated)
 * ------ ---------  --- -----------
 * the returned codeword-length lookup table
 * deallocate after use
 *
 * History (with dates)
 * -------  ---- -----
 * 1.0.0, 30/06/1998    first release
