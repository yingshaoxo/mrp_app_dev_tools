/**** MakeHuffDecodeTable8, MakeHuffDecodeTable16, MakeHuffDecodeTable32 ************
 *
 * Version & Date
 * -------   ----
 * 1.0.0, 30/06/1998
 *
 * Description
 * -----------
 * generate the codeword-to-symbol lookup tables for each size of symbol data
 *
 * Inputs
 * ------
 *   symbols
 *   - an array of symbols that occurred in the data that was coded that must be sorted into
 *     increasing order of frequency of occurrence
 *     the type for the symbols and hence size of symbols must be defined by SIZE before
 *     this macro file is included
 *   nsymbols
 *   - the number of symbols referenced by the symbol array
 *   freqcodelen
 *   - an array of frequency of occurrence for each length of codeword
 *   maxcodewlen
 *   - the maximum length of codeword that can be decoded
 *     (maxcodewlen + 1) defines the last index into the array freqcodelen
 *   tablebits
 *   - the maximum length of codeword that can be decoded directly using a lookup table
 *     all lengths of codeword over this being decoded using a tree
 *   lentable
 *   - a pointer to an array to hold the decoded codeword length table/tree
 * Outputs
 * -------
 *   lentable
 *   - a pointer to the decoded codeword length table/tree that is synchronised with the
 *     decoded symbol table/tree that is returned
 * Return Values
 * ------ ------
 *     unsigned char *, unsigned short * or unsigned int *
 *           - an array that represents the codeword-to-symbol lookup table/tree
 *             with the size of the data items determined by the value of SIZE that must
 *             be defined before this macro is called
 *     NULL	 - some error occurred (memory failed?)
 *
 * Memory allocated (not deallocated)
 * ------ ---------  --- -----------
 * the returned length and symbol lookup tables/trees
 * deallocate after use
 *
 * History (with dates)
 * -------  ---- -----
 * 1.0.0, 30/06/1998    first release
