	MACRO
	BCDADD	$c, $a, $b, $t, $constant1, $constant2, $withcarry
		DISTINCT $constant1, $constant2
		DISTINCT $a, $c, $t
		DISTINCT $b, $c, $t
		DISTINCT $constant2, $t
		
		;Suppose we add a, b and 0x66666666. Look at the least significant nibble
		;("LSN") of this sum. This will generate a carry into the next nibble if:
		;
		;LSN(a) + LSN(b) + 6 >= 16,
		;
		;i.e. if:
		;
		;LSN(a) + LSN(b) >= 10.
		;
		;Which is precisely the condition we want for whether the LSN of the BCD
		;sum generates a carry into the next nibble.
		;
		;Looking at the next nibble, we then find that it generates a carry into
		;the third nibble if:
		;
		;NextNybble(a) + NextNybble(b) + (Carry from LSN) + 6 >= 16,
		;
		;i.e. if:
		;
		;NextNybble(a) + NextNybble(b) + (Carry from LSN) >= 10,
		;
		;which is precisely when we want this nibble to generate a carry into the
		;third nibble in the BCD sum. This clearly continues all the way through,
		;so the carries between nibbles in the a+b+0x66666666 addition are
		;precisely those we want between the BCD digits.
		
		ADDS    $c,$a,$b             ;start BCD equivalent of ADD $c, $a, $b
									 ;but corrupts the flags else...
	    ;ADCS	$c, $a, $b			 ;...use this line instead to perform the BCD
	    							 ;equivalent of ADC $c, $a, $b which adds
	    							 ;the carry flag as well
	    
	    ADD     $t,$constant1,$c,RRX ;Generate sum with BCD carries
	    EOR     $t,$t,$a,LSR #1      ; )
	    EOR     $t,$t,$b,LSR #1      ; ) Isolate those carries
	    AND     $t,$t,$constant2     ; )
	    ADD     $c,$c,$t,LSR #1      ;Adjust sum according to the BCD
	    ADD     $c,$c,$t,LSR #2      ; carries
	    
		;After the first instruction, c contains the 33 bit unsigned sum of a
		;and b. So the RRX shift in the second instruction ends up generating the
		;true unsigned version of (a+b) >> 1, and the addition of 0x33333333 then
		;gives us (a+b+0x66666666) >> 1. So to get the carries out of each of the
		;nibbles of the BCD sum, we want the carries into bits 3, 7, 11, 15, 19,
		;23, 27 and 31 of the result of the second instruction. (Note that although
		;three operands have been added together, there can only be a single carry
		;out of any nibble, because the operand nibbles are all 0-9 and the third
		;nibble is effectively 6.)
		;
		;To get the carry into a bit of a sum which is known to have only had a
		;single carry into it, you can use the fact that:
		;
		;(sum bit) = (EOR of all the operand bits) EOR (carry in bit),
		;
		;or equivalently:
		;
		;(carry in bit) = (EOR of all the operand bits) EOR (sum bit)
		;
		;Since the relevant bits of the constant 0x33333333 are all zero, we can
		;EOR with a >> 1 and b >> 1 to get a value in which bits 3, 7, 11, 15,
		;19, 23, 27 and 31 are the desired BCD carries out of each nibble. Then
		;ANDing with 0x88888888 will isolate those carries.
		
		;Now all we have to do is add 6 to each nibble of the original sum of a
		;and b which should have produced a BCD carry out, to force its value to
		;the correct BCD digit and to force it to produce a carry into the next
		;nibble if it hasn't already.
		;
		;Note that the carry out from the top nibble of the BCD addition is
	    ;in bit 31 of $t so the code might be adjusted to move this into the
	    ;carry flag which would allow the synthesis of multi-precision BCD
	    ;additions

		;This uses the same sort of ideas as the BCDADD code. To start with,
		;suppose we do the 32-bit subtraction a-b. Then for each byte, we know:
		;
		;  If (a byte) > (b byte), no "borrow" will be generated from the next byte
		;  up during this subtraction.
		;
		;  If (a byte) < (b byte), a "borrow" will definitely be generated from the
		;  next byte up during this subtraction.
		;
		;  If (a byte) = (b byte), a "borrow" may or may not be generated from the
		;  next byte during this subtraction: whether it is depends on whether this
		;  byte receives a "borrow" from the next byte down.
		;
		;So a suitable value for d has:
		;
		;  Bit 0 = "borrow" from bit 8 generated by bit 7 during the subtraction;
		;  Bit 8 = "borrow" from bit 16 generated by bit 15 during the subtraction;
		;  Bit 16 = "borrow" from bit 24 generated by bit 23 during the subtraction;
		;  Bit 24 = "borrow" from outside the word generated by bit 31 during the
		;    subtraction;
		;  All other bits zero.
		;
		;The C flag generated by a SUBS instruction is equal to NOT("borrow" from
		;outside the word), so the ORRCC instruction puts the right value into bit 24
		;of d. The other three "borrows" required are found by using the fact that:
		;
		;  (Bit i of a-b) = (a bit i) EOR (b bit i) EOR ("borrow" from bit i)
		;
		;so that:
		;
		;  ("borrow" from bit i) = (a bit i) EOR (b bit i) EOR (Bit i of a-b)
		;
		;and so the EOR/SUBS/EOR/AND sequence puts the right values into bits 0, 8
		;and 16 of d.
		;
		;The code then uses d to generate a bit mask equal to 0x00 in the bytes
		;where a is wanted and to ((a byte) EOR (b byte)) in the bytes where b is
		;wanted. Finally, this is EORed with a to produce the desired value for c.

		; We start by doing a "parallel addition" of the words. The basic idea
		; here is that if we have two 32-bit values a and b, and we calculate
		; x = a AND b, y = a EOR b, then at each bit position, we have:
		;
		;   2*(x bit) + (y bit) = (a bit) + (b bit)
		;
		; i.e. we have effectively added 32 1-bit numbers in parallel, storing the
		; least significant bit of each sum in y and the next bit in x. This
		; idea is extended here to produce something similar which does:
		;
		;   4*(c bit) + 2*(b bit) + (a bit)
		;     = (a bit)+(b bit)+(c bit)+(d bit)+(e bit)+(f bit)+(g bit)
		;
		; Relationships like this are denoted in an abbreviated way in the
		; comments below - this one is described as 4c+2b+a :=
		; a+b+c+d+e+f+g, for instance.
		;
		; Then we just have to calculate 4*popcount(c)+2*popcount(b)+popcount(a)
		; to get the desired result. Some code is saved here by only doing part of
		; the popcount operations before combining the results.
		;
		; The net result is 46 instructions and 46 cycles to do a population count on
		; 224 bits, i.e. a counting rate of nearly 5 bits per cycle. (As a point of
		; comparison, naive code which simply shifts the bits out of the registers and
		; increments a register each time a 1 is shifted out is likely to end up more
		; like 2-6 cycles per bit, depending on the amount of loop unrolling i.e.
		; this code is about 10-30 times faster.)
