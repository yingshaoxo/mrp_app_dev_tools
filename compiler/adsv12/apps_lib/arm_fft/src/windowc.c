 * window with the required number of points in the window as given
 *
 * Inputs
 * ------
 *   windowCoeff
 *   - a fixed-point (after bit 14) coefficient that determines window
 *     HAMMING : perform a Hamming window (0x1D70)
 *     HANNING : perform a Hanning window (0x2000)
 *     int     : anything else generates an error
 *   nDataPoints
 *   - the number of points that should be in the window
 * Return Values
 * ------ ------
 *     int * - an array that contains the windowing data with nDataPoints data points
 *             the data is returned as fixed-point (after bit 14) sign-extended
 *     NULL  - some error occurred (memory allocation?)
