<!-- here are some entities useful in describing attribute values. -->

Typically, a region element would contain the text visible in the region. -->

<!-- NOTES:
The idref attribute is intended to be used as a pointer to a link end element.
The TEI attribute is intended to be a TEI locator for a link end.  Either
the TEI attribute or the idref attribute should be used, not both.
The book and coll attributes are for specifiying a collection and book for
cross book links.

Coordinates are expressed in units relative to each axis of each graphic.
Coordinates are real numbers between 0.0 and 1.0.  (Exponential notation is not
supported.) Thus the point (0.5 0.5) is in the center (vertically and
horizontally) of any graphic, no matter what its shape or size.  (0.0 0.0) is
the upper left corner.  (1.0 1.0) is the lower right.

Each point is expressed as two coordinates (horizontal followed by vertical), 
separated by a space, and surrounded by parentheses.

A list of points is a space-separated concatination of points.

This DTD shows region elements which can contain only #PCDATA.  It could be
modified so that regions contain any valid SGML.  I show this to indicate how
we could store such information to enable searching within a graphic.
