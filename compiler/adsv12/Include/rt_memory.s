; This module gives a framework for writing custom memory models
; in. It actually implements a very simple memory model, in which:
;
;  - the stack is 64Kb and grows down from 0x80000000
;  - the heap is 128Kb and grows up from 0x60000000
;  - a stack overflow is instantly fatal and does not even raise SIGSTAK
;  - no extra memory is available for the heap

        ; This include file defines rt_mm0, rt_mm1, rt_mm2 and
        ; rt_mm3 to be the offsets from the start of the
        ; __user_libspace block of four words of storage available
        ; for use by the memory model.

        ; Initialisation function. This routine isn't required to
